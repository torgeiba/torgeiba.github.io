# On the binomial theorem

The binomial theorem is a useful tool when working with polynomials.
It can be written as follows:

$$ (x + y)^d = \sum_{i=0}^d  \binom{d}{i} x^{d-i}y^i $$

The name derives from the sum of two variables (monomial, binomial, ..., polynomial).
The factor $\binom{d}{i}$ is called the binomial coefficient.

The binomial coefficients can be defined in a number of ways.
They can be defined to be the coefficients where the binomial theorem holds,
but they can also be defined in terms of a ratio of factorials

$$\binom{d}{i} = \frac{d!}{(d-o)!\,i!}$$

The core aspect of the theorem is that it relates what is essentially a product of sums
to a sum of products.

$$ (x + y)^d = \prod_{i=0}^d (x + y)  = \sum_{i=0}^d  \binom{d}{i} x^{d-i}y^i $$
